        <p>
            This is a recipe which I, Kyle Fingerhut have developed over years as a seasoned chef. I have experimented diligently to perfect this recipe so you don't have to.

        <p>
            This recipe is suitable for one or many people and can be freely combined with the noodle of your choice (though I do prefer rigatoni).

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>four tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>three cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>one medium sized white onion, diced</li>
            <li>two 12 ounce cans of Italian tomatoes</li>
            <li>two tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
            <li>two tablespoons of Italian spice mix</li>
            <li>a sprig or two of fresh basil, chopped</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
            <li>optional: teaspoon of sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the oil to a deep-sided pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is slick, add the garlic and onion along with a dash of salt. Saut√© for roughly five minutes until the onions become transluscent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, spices, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, immediately lower to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and transfer to a blender. Pulse until the sauce reaches the desired texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer back to the pot and add the fresh basil once the sauce has slightly cooled.</li>
            <li>Taste and, if acidic, add sugar to cut the acidity. Add salt and red pepper flakes to taste.</li>
        </ol>
